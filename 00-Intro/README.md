# Session 0: Installation and exploration of the Julia language
[Main](../README.md) | [Next](../01-HPC/README.md)

## OBJECTIVE: Successfully Explore Julia
- [ ] **KR1:** Julia can be run using the terminal, the Julia REPL appears
- [ ] **KR2:** Execute via the Julia REPL basic arithmetic expressions such as 2+3, or 3^4
- [ ] **KR3:** Tried several basic mathematical operations such as exponentiation, as well as known functions such as trigonometric and exponents.
- [ ] **KR4:** Switched to the four REPL modes (check the docs for these)
- [ ] **KR5:** Assign a generated 200x200 random matrix via the command rand()
- [ ] **KR6:** Try out other basic tricks in one of the tutorial pages.

# Julia tutorials
Based on experience, the best go-to sites are the main references indicated in [the Syllabus](SYLLABUS.md).

# Installing Julia
Julia app can be directly downloaded from the Julialang.org “Download Julia” page (https://julialang.org/downloads). This will provide CLI Julia. I recommend downloading the latest stable (22 August 2022), **v 1.8.0**.

# Julia Tutorials
These links are found in the updated websites of Julialang.org and others. There should be no need to enroll in other resource. However, if you have the opportunity to access them, that’s no worry.

Remember that in the end, we just wish to become Physicist who can use the computer to help us in our discovery.

# Installing Jupyter notebook
**Jupyter Notebooks** are fun to use.
Notebooks can contain discussions like a diary.

Since we will eventually use this as a way to submit your homeworks, here are the links from where you will be able to download the Jupyter installations.
- Main page: (https://jupyter.org)
- Jupyter Notebook documentation: (https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- Jupyter Notebook installation will require Python installation via (Anaconda)[https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution]
- Installing IJulia and Julia kernel into Jupyter: (https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl)

## Additional notes
Here, I initially utilized the `Pluto` package of Julia.
You may check out `j1-basic-julia.jl` for the exploration.
Some tricks may be found in the `j1-plot-mandel.jl`.
