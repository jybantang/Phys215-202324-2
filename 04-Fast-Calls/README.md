# Session 4: Fast function calls
[Previous](../03-Types/) | [Main](../) | Next

# **OBJECTIVE**: Compare benchmark times of different implementation of functions that can be expressed as a recursion relation.
 - [ ] **KR1:** Benchmarked at least two(2) different implementation of the same function or process (e.g. raising each element of an array to some power `p`, random array may be used) that utilizes some parameter that can be considered a constant or declared globally.
 Typical methods: (1) Global variable, (2) Constant global variable, and (3) Named parameter variable.
 - [ ] **KR2:** Replicated the naive implementation of the polynomial in the textbook.
 - [ ] **KR3:** Replicated the naive implementation of the Horner's method for the same polynomial.
 - [ ] **KR4:** Replicated the macro implementation of the Horner's method of the same polynomial.
 - [ ] **KR5:** Table showing how many _minutes_ will the function evaluations in both KR3 and KR4 be reduced if KR2 requires 24hours of runtime.
