## Class mode
This semester, we will have a mixture of the following modes:
1. Face-to-face physical class with option to HyperFlex (with simultaneous Zoom session).
2. Pure synchronous online session.
3. Asynchronous mode : Interaction with classmates and experts in the Discord server is encouraged.

## Necessities:
1. Computer (laptop or desktop) with Internet access<sup>[1](#gpu-note)</sup>
2. Patience and enthusiasm
3. Browser bookmarks of the following sites:
	1. [The Julia documentation page](https://docs.julialang.org)
	2. [A Julia packages shortcut repository](https://juliapackages.com)
	3. [Wikibooks: Introducing Julia](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia)
4. Access to book references such as follows
	1. **[MAIN]** Avik Sengupta. Julia High Performance, 2nd Ed. (Packt Publishing, 2019). Available from [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/product/julia-high-performance-second-edition/9781788298117) and [Amazon (as Kindle book)](https://www.amazon.com/Julia-High-Performance-Avik-Sengupta-ebook-dp-B0748MTFVL/dp/B0748MTFVL).
	3. Ben Lauwens and Allen Downey. [Think Julia: How to think like a computer scientist](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html). This is a good basic reference for Applied Physics 155 level of introduction for Julia.
	4. Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe. [Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra, VLMS](http://vmls-book.stanford.edu)
	5. Other resources may appear in the Google Classroom, and in the Discord server.

## Course Goals
At the end of the semester, the student will be able to:
- **[G1]** Identify basic principles in high-performance computation especially those accessible via Julia as a programming language;
- **[G2]** Solve at least one ODE-based problem using numerical approach in Julia, showing the
solutions in graphical plots;
- **[G3]** Implement known numerical methods / algorithm for solving or simulating basic physical models using Julia as the programming language;
- **[G4]** Identify critical principles of simulation and modeling in at least one project involving physical system modeling or simulation;
- **[G5]** Submit at least one completed project implemented using Julia programming language clearly demonstrating at least two out of the first four (G1-G4) above.

## Topics
The sequence of topics will generally follow the MAIN book reference following each chapter.
Discussions will be live synchronous activity every Thursdays to discuss the chapter and computational physics topics.
I expect everyone to use the Tuesday schedule in finishing the allocated homework sessions posted in the Google Classroom.
This list may change as determined by the instructor. Each number will generally be allocated for the week number of the semester.

The listing of the topics is found in the [Main Page](README.md).

## Course Requirements
Students are expected to submit the following requirements with their corresponding percentage of the total course grade.
1. **Exercises** (Ex≥5 coding exercises, individual): 60% 
2. **Projects:**
	1. **Mini-projects** (Pm≥1 project, individual up to trio): 20%. _Must demonstrate at least one(1) of the Course Goals._
	2. **Final Project** (Pf=1 project, individual up to trio): 20%. _Must demonstrate at least two(2) of the Course Goals._

## Class Policy
_Class attendance._ Class attendance is not required but the completed Exercises and Project must be submitted before the deadline set. Late submissions may still be accepted but have final scores reduced by a factor of the remaining days before the Grade Submission deadline.
All class sessions and class consultations will be done via available online platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet, or Discord.
Submissions must be done via the Google Classrooms. Submissions via other means may tend to be lost in transmission and deemed unreliable.

_Exercises._ Each topic will require submission of exercise(s) which will individually contribute to the total score under the category of Exercises. Exercise solutions will be submitted online.

_Mini-project(s)._ At least one mini-project will be required towards the mid-semester from which the Final project may be based from. At least one of the Course Goals (one of G1 through G4] must be demonstrated as achieved in mini-projects.

_Final project._ Only one(1) final project more complex than the mini-projects will be required to be submitted by the end of the semester. Given the practicality of the circumstances, either a live oral or recorded video presentation of the results may be required (submitted). At least two(2) of the Course Goals (one of G1 through G4] must be demonstrated as achieved in the final-project.

## Submission modes
Submission modes are described in the [Main Page](README.md).

## Notes
<a name="gpu-note">[1]</a> The computer must have at least more than two cores. Having GPU cores is desirable but not required. The Internet access is necessary for downloading and installing related apps and codes Julia and GitHub.
