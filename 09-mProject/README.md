# mProject : Mini-project ideas
[Back to main](../README.md)

**OBJECTIVE:** Identify critical principles of simulation and modeling in at least one project involving physical system modeling or simulation

The simulation can be taken from different dynamical systems well-known in Physics such as
 - [Chaos](./Chaos/README.md)
 - [Cellular automata](./Cellular-Automata/README.md)
 - [Game theory](./Game-Theory/README.md)
 - [Dynamics](./Dynamics/README.md)
 - [CS Segregation model](./mProject-1/README.md) - with template for filling codes and discussions

You may suggest other topics / systems not included in this listing.

# Key results
 - [ ] **KR1:** Approved proposed project topic based on well-recognized dynamical system (not active research)
 - [ ] **KR2:** Replicated result(s) such as plot of the original work.
 - [ ] **KR3:** Demonstrated at least one(1) of the Course Goals found in the [Syllabus](../SYLLABUS.md).
  The specific goal must be identified (G1 to G3).

*Special condition*: Submitted as individual or up to trio
