# Mini Project 1 : Basic Schelling Segregation Model

The Schelling's model of segregation is an agent-based model developed by economist Thomas Schelling (see [Wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling%27s_model_of_segregation) for more details).
You will provide exploration of increasing computational efficiency with matrices while working only with basic model without the cost function for migration.

**Mini-Project 1 OBJECTIVE:** Investigate computational efficiency of a customized implementation of the basic Schelling segregation model.
- [ ] KR1: A running implementation of the basic Schelling segregation model based on the original paper.
- [ ] KR2: Discussion of the comparison of results to the original paper results, considering the appropriate model parameter range.
- [ ] KR3: Identified lines or parts of the implementation that are possible areas for consideration to increase efficiency (hint: profiler).
- [ ] KR4: Benchmark summary & discussion of the best alternative implementations explored.
- [ ] KR5: A short discussion on the simplified run-time computational complexity of the final implementation.

You may clone the initial code and use it as template for your project documentation.
Rename by: removing the `init-` part of the filename and change the `[SURNAME-First_Name]` appropriately.

A scratch notebook maybe useful.
Transfer final codes into the project documentation.
Make sure that the final
