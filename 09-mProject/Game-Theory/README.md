# mProject: Self-organizing systems

Self-organizing systems are systems with dynamics that exhibit [self-organized crticality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organized_criticality).
A good review ["Complexity, contingency, and criticality"](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.15.6689) by Bak and Paczuski (1995) on complexity features is available among many others.

Some known self-organizing systems are:
 - [El Farol Bar problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Farol_Bar_problem)
 - [Bak-Sneppen model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakâ€“Sneppen_model)
 - [Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model)
 - [Forest-fire model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest-fire_model)
 - [Rock-paper-scissors game with mutations](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.91.052907)
 - Certain application of the [ant-colony optimization algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms)
