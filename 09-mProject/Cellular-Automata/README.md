# mProject: Cellular Automata

Cellular Automata (CA) is another dynamical modeling paradigm inspired by its mathematical roots.
One defining feature of CA systems is their simplicity of dynamical definition yet can often show interesting properties.

The following are well-known CA systems:
 - [Elementary cellular automata (ECA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton)
 - [Nagel-Schreckenberg traffic model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagelâ€“Schreckenberg_model)
 - [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
 - [Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model)
