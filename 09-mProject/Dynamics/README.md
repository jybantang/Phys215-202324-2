# mProject: Dynamics

Topics on this miniproject can range from implementation of any of the following or similar.
- Comparison of the trajectory of a rotating ball against a non-rorating case.
- Comparison of the trajectory of a projectile with non-linear (or layered) drag coefficient function (of velocity).
- Exploration of the N-body integrator of the Julia package [`NbodySimulator.jl`](https://nbodysimulator.sciml.ai/dev/#Basic-Components)
- Exploration of a sliding box system with stripped rough ramp (see [here](./project-sliding-object.ipynb)).
