# mProject: Chaos

Chaos is a topic in this mini-Project.
[Chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory) is one of the possible properties of non-linear dynamical systems.
One of the [few properties of (mathematicaly) chaotic systems](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Chaos.html) is **sensitivity to initial conditions**.

The following are the well-known chaotic systems
 - [Logistic map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), [Hénon map](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Chaos.html) and other chaotic maps (discrete time)
 - [Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system)), [Rössler system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rössler_attractor) and other attractor systems (continuous time)
 - [Double pendulum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum), [Three-body system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem) using Newtonian mechanics and other non-linear dynamical systems (ODE-based)
